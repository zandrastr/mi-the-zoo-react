Users can update the feeding status, which also updates the exact date and time of the last feeding.

This is a school assignment with the goal of learning more about React and TypeScript.

- React routes
- API services
- React hooks (for example useEffect and useState)
- TypeScript 
- JavaScript logic
- The use of LocalStorage
- Error handling
- Git
